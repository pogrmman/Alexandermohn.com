Title: About Me

In case you haven't already gleaned it from the url, my name is Alexander Mohn.
I really enjoy growing plants, the more strange and unusual the better. I also have
fun programming, stargazing, backpacking, reading, and learning about whatever I can.

I grew up in and live in Austin, Texas. I'm intersted by the ecology, geology, and
history of this area. I've spend a good amount of time exploring the different flora
of this area and found so many little hidden surprises. Even in my suburban
neighborhood, we have an amazing array of different plants, some of which don't
grow elsewhere.

My fascination with plants and the natural world started when I was really young. I
remember "helping" my father grow all sorts of different passionvines when I was just
5 or 6 years old. I was super curious about all the different flowers and leaf shapes
and the caterpillars that routinely devoured them. Later, in elementary school, other
various groups of plants captured my interest, although I did not grow them. In 5th
grade, I discovered carnivorous plants and was immediately hooked. The incredible
number of various intricate and beautiful mechanisms to capture insects astounded me.
Learning about how they adapted to their habitats to gain a competitive advantage was
amazing. I joined the
[International Carnivorous Plant Society](https://carnivorousplants.org/) and began
growing a range of different carnivores. As I became older and learned more about
other plants, I became drawn in to the immense diversity of the plant kingdom.
Seemingly every plant has wonderful and interesting adaptations to their habitat,
although not all are as obvious as the carnivores.
